        <p>Our senses are the only things we can perceive the outer world through. Since our senses are full of errors and often deceive us, they are not trustable. So we can't be sure of an outer world's existence.</p>
        <p>With radical doubt, we doubt everything down to its truth. If a thing gives the slightest error or deception, while it may not be a false thing, we reject it for the greater search for somnething that is fully certain.</p>
