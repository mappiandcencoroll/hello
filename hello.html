        <h1>I think, therefore I am.</h1>
        <p>Our senses are the only things we can perceive the outer world through. Since our senses are full of errors and often deceive us, they are not trustable. So we can't be sure of an outer world's existence.</p>
        <p>With radical doubt, we doubt everything down to its truth. If a thing gives the slightest error or deception, while it may not be a false thing, we reject it for the greater search for somnething that is fully certain.</p>
        <p>We can doubt everything, but we can't doubt the very truth that we are doubting. That doubting is occuring, that thinking is happening. Now, thinking needs a subject for it to occur, which points that your brain must exist to think. Thus, your brain exists.</p>
        <p>You can't be certain of other thing's existence as you can't step out of your brain to see if a thing is there.</p>
        <p><strong>However, Humes argued against it and said that thinking is only an experience. While it's true that thinking is occuring, according to him, it doesn't automatically point that it needs a subject or a brain to occur. It attacks the <em>"...therefore I am"</em> part of Descartes' argument.</strong></p>
